Modules and Functions Used  
 
 
 
Modules: 
1. mysql.connector 
This module enables connectivity and interaction with a MySQL 
database. It allows the program to establish connections to the 
local MySQL server and executes SQL queries, and perform 
database related operations like creating tables, inserting 
data, and retrieving information. 
 
2. tabulate 
The tabulate module facilitates the presentation of data in a 
tabular format. It's utilized to neatly display fetched data from 
the database (such as client lists, movie details) in a 
structured and visually appealing manner. 
 
3. csv 
 
The csv module assists in reading from and writing to CSV 
(Comma-Separated Values) files. In this context, it's used to 
manage a file named 'booking.csv', storing booking information 
including reference IDs, movie details, dates, timings, seat 
types, and prices. 
 
4. random 
The random module provides functionalities to generate 
random numbers. Within the program, it's employed to create a 
unique reference ID for each booking made by a user. 
 
5. os 
The os module provides a way to interact with the operating 
system. In this program, it's used to perform file-related 
operations such as renaming and removing files. For instance, 
when canceling a ticket, it renames and removes entries in the 
'booking.csv' file. 
 
6. datetime and calendar 
These modules handle date and time-related operations. They 
enable the program to manage dates for booking tickets, 

 
ensuring that bookings can only be made for future dates and 
providing a calendar view for date selection. 
 
Key Functions: 
Book_ticket(id): 
The booking function lets users reserve movie tickets by 
picking the movie, date, timing, seat type, and number of seats. 
It calculates the total cost and gives a unique booking ID. It 
helps users by showing a calendar for date selection and 
checking seat availability for future dates. While choosing the 
dates it shows a calendar of the month to help customers 
choose the right dates. If someone enters wrong details, like 
too many seats or an invalid date, the system guides them to 
fix it. It uses clear instructions and checks to make sure users 
enter the right info, like valid timings and future dates, to avoid 
mistakes. Overall, it's made to be easy to use and helps users 
avoid errors while booking tickets. 
 
Dry_start(): 
The "dry start" function serves as a setup tool, creating the 
initial database structure and essential tables like client, 
admin, movie, and booking. It's particularly useful during the 
 
system's first launch or when starting from scratch, setting up 
the entire database and necessary tables without existing data. 
This always the system to be initialized without any adminâ€™s 
inputs. This creates a clean environment, ensuring all 
essential tables are in place and ready for use. During a "dry 
start," it establishes the database, creates admin and client 
tables, initializes an admin account, sets up the movie table 
structure, and prepares the booking CSV file for future use. 
This function streamlines the initial setup process, ensuring 
the system is ready to handle user registrations, movie details, 
and ticket bookings right from the start.
